        	<p>This is the "about me" part of the profile. You can find out most general information about the designer here.</p>
                    <p>I am a 19 year old student currently studying Creative Digital Media in ITB. I am in my first year of the three-four year course and im enjoying everything in the course so far. I come from the west of Ireland, Co. Clare. The landscape everywhere around here is beautiful and always facinated me to want to capture it in its beautiful states. What first got me into media was my love of films and documentries. I loved the cinematography, and would be nearly more interested in watching the making of shows as to the actual thing.</p>
                    <p>What interested me into doing this course was the diversity of what you could do. most courses focused on doing only certain parts of media while ITBs course allows you to do all. My interest first began with photography from a very young age, and has never left me. But now from doing only one year of this course I have realised that there is much more in the digital media course that i would be interested in following for a career. My outcome for this website is to create an online web portfolio.</p>
